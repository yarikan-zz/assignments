# CHIsentiment: Tweets, Sentiments, and Chicago Community Areas

In this project I use sentiment analysis and descriptive statistics to explore 
Twitter data that mentions a Chicago community area and was posted from within 
15 miles of the city and within the previous 6-9 days. Ultimately the purpose is to 
better understand the relationship between how people think, feel, and talk about 
neighborhoods and what the experiences, trends, and compositions of those neighborhoods 
are. This can potentially contribute to how we understand and evaluate the impact of 
various types of urban redevelopment strategies. Ideally this is to be studied 
longitudinally (e.g., changes over months or longer, not less than 2 weeks), and must
take into account and address limitations such as the distribution of Twitter usage. 

So far, findings from my analysis suggest that:

a) How users talk about Englewood on Twitter does not align with that community area's 
general reputation. Englewood is located on the South Side of Chicago, and generally has 
a reputation for being high on poverty, crime, and foreclosures. Reality, however, is 
much more varied than that, because the area includes a number of resources that offer 
strengths and opportunities for residents that may not be captured by labor economics 
variables (e.g., churches, transitional job programs, community colleges). When 
examining the top 10 negative tweets from a body of 35 (that is, 35 tweets over the 
previous 6-9 days from within Chicago and mentioning Englewood, see the analysis titled 
"Most Positive vs Negative Tweets for Each Dataset" in the project's main ipython3 
notebook), we see that six of these most negative tweets actually discuss positive 
experiences, such as promoting and having gone to vote in a recent local election, and 
announcing a job opening. The (in)accuracy of the sentiment analysis may explain this 
batter, as well as the highly limited number of tweets.

b) "O'Hare" is the most often mentioned within the second, much larger dataset of 
tweets that mention any of the 77 community areas AND originate from within the city. 
This pattern is supported by the dramatic graphic I've developed of the number of tweets 
per day that mention a particular community area: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yarikan/assignments/master/Final_Project/tweets_mention_community_areas_per_day.png?token=AQAvwDdJu40WVLGotPje6g0fIagjCV8Aks5W9LZHwA%3D%3D.  
I assume O'Hare's frequency has more to do with the airport and its popularity in 
domestic and international travel than feelings about a neighborhood. 

In any case, much more work needs to be done to add and improve on these observations. 
I look forward to it. :)
