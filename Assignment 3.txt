-- QUESTION 1: HANDLERS EXPLORATION
-- Use hhadler table which provides registration forms for hazardous waste handlers

-- a) How many forms have been received by the EPA?
SELECT COUNT(receive_date)
FROM hhandler;
-- A total of 2,280,394 forms have been received by the EPA.


-- (b) How many facilities have registered? Hint: use the count(distinct ) function
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT epa_handler_id)
FROM hhandler;
-- A total of 856,529 facilities have registered.


-- (c) How many forms were received per year over the last 5 years?
-- Hint: Convert the receive_date to a date using ::date and use a GROUP BY. 
SELECT extract(YEAR from receive_date::date), count(*)
FROM hhandler
WHERE extract(YEAR from receive_date::date)='2012'
OR extract(YEAR from receive_date::date)='2013'
OR extract(YEAR from receive_date::date)='2014'
OR extract(YEAR from receive_date::date)='2015'
OR extract(YEAR from receive_date::date)='2016'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
-- FYI I'm assuming that "last 5 years" includes records so far for 2016.
-- 92,413 forms were received in 2012.
-- 87,378 forms were received in 2013.
-- 128,099 forms were received in 2014.
-- 59,757 forms were received in 2015.
-- 2,844 forms were received so far in 2016.


-- QUESTION 2: EVALUATIONS
-- The cmecomp3 table contains a list of evaluations (inspections) of these handlers. See the data dictionary here.

-- (a) How many evaluations are there?
SELECT COUNT(evaluation_identifier)
FROM cmecomp3;
-- There are 2,060,714 evaluations.


-- (b) How many evaluations found violations?
SELECT COUNT(evaluation_identifier)
FROM cmecomp3
WHERE found_violation_flag='Y';
-- 1,478,260 inspections found violations.

-- Note to self, can calculate the same result using fewer lines as follows:
-- SELECT sum((found_violation_flag='Y')::int)
-- FROM cmecomp3;


-- (c) What proportion of evaluations found violations?
SELECT (sum((found_violation_flag='Y')::int)*1.0 / COUNT(evaluation_identifier))*100
FROM cmecomp3;
-- Approximatey 72% of inspections found violations.


-- (d) Which five handler_ids have been found in violation the most times? How many times? 
-- Also find these handlers' site names in the hhandlers table.
-- Hint: Use a GROUP BY and an ORDER BY DESC.

-- I solved part (d) in two steps. Here is step 1: 
SELECT handler_id, count(*)
FROM cmecomp3
WHERE found_violation_flag='Y'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- Using what I found in Step 1, here is Step 2: 
SELECT current_site_name, epa_handler_id
FROM hhandler
WHERE epa_handler_id='KYD053348108'
OR epa_handler_id='ILD048843809'
OR epa_handler_id='ILD006296800'
OR epa_handler_id='KY0000005785'
OR epa_handler_id='ILD000714881'
GROUP BY epa_handler_id, current_site_name
ORDER BY epa_handler_id;

-- The top 5 violators are as follows, starting with the most frequent one:
-- Handler KYD053348108 (Safety - Kleen Systems) with 4,772 violations.
-- Handler ILD048843809 (Chemet Co) with 4,311 violations.
-- Handler ILD006296800 (Musick Plating CO) with 3,481 violations.
-- Handler KY0000005785 (Designtec Recycling Center) with 2,396 violations.
-- Handler ILD000714881 (Keystone Steel & Wire CO) with 2,379 violations.


-- QUESTION 3: INDUSTRIES
-- The North American Industry Classification System is a system used by federal agencies 
-- to classify a business according to its industry. The naics table contains this information 
-- as retrieved from here. Start by skimming this file.

-- (a) How many different naics codes are there? 
-- How many six-digit industry classifications are there? 
-- How many two-digit classifications are there? These determine the sectors as described here.

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT naics)
FROM naics
WHERE naics <> '------';
-- There are a total of 2,015 different classifications.

SELECT COUNT(naics)
FROM naics
WHERE naics SIMILAR TO '[0-9]*';
-- There are 978 different six-digit industry classifications.

SELECT COUNT(naics)
FROM naics
WHERE naics SIMILAR TO '[0-9][0-9][^0-9]*';
-- There are 20 two-digit classifications.


-- (b) The hnaics table contains naics codes for some handlers. 
-- How many handlers have naics codes? How many don't?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT epa_handler_id)
FROM hnaics
WHERE naics_code SIMILAR TO '[0-9]*';
-- 437,962 handlers do have naics codes.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT epa_handler_id) - 
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT epa_handler_id) 
FROM hnaics 
WHERE naics_code SIMILAR TO '[0-9]*')
FROM hnaics;
-- 91 handlers do NOT have naics codes.


-- (c) Join the hnaics table with the naics table and use a GROUP BY to determine the number of 
-- facilities in each sector. Which sector has the most hazardous-waste handlers? The least?
-- Hint: You can get the digit naics code from the naics_code using this expression: 
-- substring(naics_code for 2) || '----'
-- Hint: group by naics_description to get the description instead of the code.

SELECT (substring(hnaics.naics_code for 2) || '----'), naics.naics_description, count(distinct hnaics.epa_handler_id)
FROM hnaics
JOIN naics 
	ON naics.naics = substring(hnaics.naics_code for 2) || '----'
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC; 
-- For the number of facilities in each sector, see the table generated. 
-- Sector 81, Other Services, has the most hazardous-waste handlers with 73,240. 
-- Sector 55, Management of Companies and Enterprises, has the least number of handlers with 426.

	
-- (d) Create a temporary table called hsectors containing unique pairs of handler ids and sector descriptions.
-- Hint: Use a GROUP BY to ensure only unique pairs.
-- Note: We'll discuss creating temporary tables in class on Thursday.

CREATE TEMP TABLE hsectors AS (
	SELECT naics.naics_description, hnaics.epa_handler_id
	FROM hnaics
	JOIN naics 
		ON naics.naics = substring(hnaics.naics_code for 2) || '----'
	GROUP BY 1,2,3);

SELECT * FROM hsectors limit 5;

-- (e) Join hsectors to cmecomp3, to determine for each sector: the number of handlers evaluated, 
-- the number of evaluations, the number of violations, and the proportion of evaluations finding violations. 
-- Which sector has the most violations? The highest proportion of evaluations finding violations?

-- To find number of handlers evaluated per sector:
SELECT hsectors.naics_description, COUNT(DISTINCT cmecomp3.handler_id)
FROM hsectors
JOIN cmecomp3
	ON hsectors.epa_handler_id = cmecomp3.handler_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- Sector with greatest number of handlers evaluated: Other Services (except Public Administration).
-- Sector with least number of handlers evaluated: Management of Companies and Enterprises.

-- To find number of evaluations per sector:
SELECT hsectors.naics_description, COUNT(cmecomp3.evaluation_identifier)
FROM hsectors
JOIN cmecomp3
	ON hsectors.epa_handler_id = cmecomp3.handler_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- Sector with greatest number of evaluations: Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services.
-- Sector with least number of evaluations: Accommodation and Food Services.

-- To find the number of violations per sector:
SELECT hsectors.naics_description, COUNT(cmecomp3.found_violation_flag='Y')
FROM hsectors
JOIN cmecomp3
	ON hsectors.epa_handler_id = cmecomp3.handler_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- Sector with greatest number of violations: Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services.
-- Sector with least number of violations: Accommodation and Food Services.

-- To find the proportion of evaluations finding violations, per sector:
SELECT hsectors.naics_description, (sum((cmecomp3.found_violation_flag='Y')::int)*1.0 / (COUNT(cmecomp3.found_violation_flag))*100)
FROM hsectors
JOIN cmecomp3
	ON hsectors.epa_handler_id = cmecomp3.handler_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- Sector with highest percentage of evaluations finding violations: Educational Services.
-- Sector with lowest percentage of evaluations finding violations: Finance and Insurance.
